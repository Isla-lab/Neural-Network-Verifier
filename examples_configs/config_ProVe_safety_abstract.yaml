# Example configuration file for the ProVe verifier
verifier:
  name: ProVe
  # Verifier's parameters
  params:
    cpu_only: True # set to False to use GPU
    time_out_cycle: 60 # maximum depth of the search tree
    time_out_checked: 0 # percentage of volume to exclude before stopping the verification
    interval_propagation_type: relaxation # use a parallel implementation of the symbolic+relaxation method of Wang. et al. 2018 (Neurify)
    memory_limit: 0 # set to 0 reach the maximum available memory and then swap to disk
    disk_limit: 0 # set to 0 to disable disk limit
    rounding: 3 # rounding of the output of the verifier
    estimation_points: 1000000 # number of points to estimate the volume of the target set


# Specify path and type of model
model:
  path: temp_files/model_2_68.h5
  type: keras

# Example of concrete property
property:
  # Choose between safety or robustness
  type: safety

  # Whether to use a concrete or abstract property
  use_abstraction: True

  # Choose between SAT / count / enumeration check
  goal: count
  
  # Choose whether to targeting safe or unsafe areas
  target_volume: unsafe

  # Property's domain to verify
  domain:

    # Condition to check
    pool_condition: max # one of the node in the first pool has to be the maximum value w.r.t. all the other nodes
